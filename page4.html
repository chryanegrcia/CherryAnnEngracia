                <h2>Exercise Reflection</h2>
                <p>Practicing the use of lists, images, videos, and audio in HTML has deepened my understanding of how multimedia elements and structured content enhance user experience on a webpage. By working with lists, I learned how to organize information clearly using both ordered and unordered formats. Incorporating images taught me about the importance of file paths, alt text for accessibility, and responsive design. Embedding videos and audio files introduced me to HTML5 media tags, attributes like controls, autoplay, and preload, as well as the importance of supporting multiple file formats for compatibility. Overall, this practice has made me more confident in building engaging and interactive web pages.</p>
