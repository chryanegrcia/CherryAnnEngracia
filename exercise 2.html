<body>
  <p>Filipinos have deep regard for education. In fact, it occupies a central place in Philippine political, economic social, and cultural life. It has always been strongly viewed as a pillar of national development and a primary avenue for social and economic mobility (Aduballijah 2015). As such, the Philippine government ensures that the Filipino people can compete with the other nations in terms of the ability, attitudes, competencies, knowledge, and skills. There were so many approaches employed by the government to see to it that all Filipinos will be critical and capable in doing things brilliantly, particularly in their respective areas of specialization.</p>
  
  <p>Likewise, the 1987 Constitution, particularly in Article XIV Section 1, guarantees the right to education of every Filipino. It provides that, "The State shall protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels and shall take appropriate steps to make education accessible to all" (Philippine 1987 Constitution).</p>
  
  <p>In fulfilling these mandates, the Senate and the House of Representatives perform their duty to enhance the educational system of the Philippines. The passage of Republic Act 10533 also known as "Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013" is the fulfillment of the two congresses to improve the educational system of the country and thereby produce Filipinos who are globally competitive individuals. The new law enables the students enough time to master skills and concepts so that they become ready for tertiary education (Republic Act 10533).</p>
  
  <p>In this new education system, there are four track subjects that lead student's interests to college program. These tracks are further subdivided into different strands to really prepare the students to have more advanced skills once they reach college, that is, if they decide to continue their higher education or help develop their skills if they are to work after graduation from the senior high school program (Cruz, 2014).</p>
  
      <h4>THEORITICAL FRAMEWORK</h4>
  
  <p>The study was anchored on the Fishbein and Ajzen's Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) developed by Martin Fishbein and Leek Ajzen. This theory recommends that person's behavior is determined by his or her intention to perform the behavior, which is a function of his or her attitude towards the behavior, as well as, subjective norms associated with the behavior. In other words, TRA explains behavior using three general constructs: behavioral intention, attitude, and subjective norms. According to the theory, behavioral intention (BI) is a function of attitude toward the behavior (AB) and subjective norms (SN) regarding the behavior. In this formulation, subjective norms stand for individuals' perceptions of the cultural expectations and understanding that define and regulate a particular behavior (Trafimow, 2009).</p>
   
      <h5>CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK</h5>
  <P>Figure 1 shows the conceptual paradigm of the research study. It illustrated how the variables used in the research interlinked with each other. This framework helped the researchers in determining the attitude of Senior High School Students of Calbayog City on the BS in Office Administration program.</P>
  
  <p>As seem in the diagrans the study adapted the Vigout-process-output DPO) research model. The first box indicated the profile of the senior high schock students in terms of their age, sex, monthly Income, and scholastic rating These were the input variables of the study. A double arrow points from the fint box to the second box showed the relationship between the two sets of variaties</p>
  
  <p>The second box focused on determining the perception of the respondents on the attitude of the senior high school students in Calbayog City towards 5 in Office Administration program. This served as the process variable and there is an arrow that interlinks between the profile of the respondents to the attitude of the senior high school students to establish whether there was a significant relationship between the two sets of variables.</p>
  
  <p>From the second box, an arrow points to the third box which elucidates the output of the study. From the results of this study, a proposed promotional plan for the BS in Office Administration program was formulated</p>
